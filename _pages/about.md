> Bio.

I am currently a research assistant in [Data Insight Research Lab](http://dirl.iis.sinica.edu.tw/) of Academia Sinica, and also a first year Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) in National Taiwan University, working with Dr. Sheng-Wei Chen and Dr. Chin-Laung Lei. My research focuses on Deep Learning and its applications in Computer Vision, especially interested in medical imageology.

In addition to my research experience, I am one of the invited speakers of [AI Month 2017](http://ds.sinica.edu.tw/ai-month-2017/) and [ML Month 2017](http://ds.sinica.edu.tw/category/2017-ml-month/) in Academia Sinica, and give a hands-on tutorials of deep learning in [Taiwan Data Science Foundation](http://foundation.datasci.tw/step-by-step-dl-170813/).
