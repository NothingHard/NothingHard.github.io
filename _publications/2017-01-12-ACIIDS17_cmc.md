excerpt: 'Recognizing the significance of transparency and accessibility of government information, the Taipei Government recently published city-wide crime data to encourage relevant research. In this project, we explore the underlying relationships between crimes and various geographic, demographic and socioeconomic factors. First we collect a total of 25 datasets from the City and other publicly available sources, and select statistically significant features via correlation tests and feature selection techniques. With the selected features, we use machine learning techniques to build a data-driven model that is capable of describing the relationship between high crime rate and the various factors.'

###

- This paper aims at exploring the underlying relationships between crimes and various geographic, demographic and socioeconomic factors.
- The results illustrates the unique effectiveness of combining spatial data and demographic, social and economic factors. Going forward, we further quantify the significance of each feature on 
- Our experimental results reveal the underlying causes of crime occurrence and advise government officials. Furthermore, our predictive model can also be used on those cells without crime occurrences yet to identify cells with similar characteristics as known places with high danger index.


### Methodology
__Data preprocessing__
- apply the grip thematic mapping techique and draw a grid over Taipei that creates 500 meters by 500 meters cells. The reasons are two fold:
	1. Ensure our boundaries enclose the same area. Because the variance in the area of villages is too large, it is difficult to perform proximity analysis that can be generalized to each village.
	2. Control the fidelity of our dataset. When the cells are too small, the village datasets obtained via village-wide statistics are too coarse to describe the cell characteristics; when the cells are too large, the level of detail of cells deteroriates.
- georeference crime locations to cells by assigning it to its closest cell, and in order to avoid spatial autocorrelation, we calculated a crime **danger index** by normalizing the number of crime cases by the number of building within each cell.
__Feature selection__
- perform a Pearson's correlation test to identify correlation between each feature, as well as with the response variable.
- use a feature ranking generated from random forests as initial feature selection process.

__Model construction__
- we train a variety of binary classifiers with 

- Apply the grip thematic mapping techique to combine different layers of spatial data, including criminal cases dataset, village profiling dataset and point of interest dataset to predefined 500 meters by 500 meters cells. 
- We collect a total of 25 datasets from publicly avaiable sources, and select statistically significant features via correlation tests and SVM-based recursive feature elimination (RFE) algroithm.
- Adopt support vector machine to build a data-driven model that is capable of describing the relat
Recognizing the significance of transparency and accessibility of government information, the Taipei Government recently published city-wide crime data to encourage relevant research. In this project, we explore the underlying relationships between crimes and various geographic, demographic and socioeconomic factors. First we collect a total of 25 datasets from the City and other publicly available sources, and select statistically significant features via correlation tests and feature selection techniques. With the selected features, we use machine learning techniques to build a data-driven model that is capable of describing the relationship between high crime rate and the various factors.

Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology by providing insights into interactions between key geographic, demographic and socioeconomic factors and city crime rate. The study shows the top three factors affecting crime rate are educational attainment, marital status, and distance to schools. The result is presented to the Taipei City officials for future government policy decision making.
