Production target setting is common in practice to guide operations such as machine allocation and lot dispatching to achieve master production schedule (MPS). This paper presents an innovative design of target setting algorithm, named TaSIV, that (1) characterizes the target-induced variability by using Markov chain analysis of tandem queues and (2) integrate the target-induced variability into a fixed-point iteration between flow estimation and machine allocation for target setting.

Over a mini-Fab example, we demonstrated that targets generated by TaSIV reduces over-optimism and close to actual moves by 30.7% of bottleneck machine groups as compared to a mean-value based scheme frequently adopted by fab operation managers. TaSIV also leads to reductions of 1.2% in mean cycle time and 15.4% in cycle time variance at 1.1% throughput increase.
