excerpt: 'Production target setting is common in practice to guide operations such as machine allocation and lot dispatching to achieve master production schedule (MPS). This paper presents an innovative design of target setting algorithm, named TaSIV, that (1) characterizes the target-induced variability by using Markov chain analysis of tandem queues and (2) integrate the target-induced variability into a fixed-point iteration between flow estimation and machine allocation for target setting.'

Production target setting is common in practice to guide operations such as machine allocation and lot dispatching to achieve master production schedule (MPS). This paper presents an innovative design of target setting algorithm, named TaSIV, that (1) characterizes the target-induced variability by using Markov chain analysis of tandem queues and (2) integrate the target-induced variability into a fixed-point iteration between flow estimation and machine allocation for target setting.
