excerpt: 'We propose the very first non-intrusive measurement methodol- ogy for quantifying the performance of commodity Virtual Reality (VR) systems. Our methodology considers the VR system under test as a black-box and works with any VR applications. Multiple performance metrics on timing and positioning accuracy are con- sidered, and detailed testbed setup and measurement steps are pre- sented. We also apply our methodology to several VR systems in the market, and carefully analyze the experiment results.'

We propose the very first non-intrusive measurement methodol- ogy for quantifying the performance of commodity Virtual Reality (VR) systems. Our methodology considers the VR system under test as a black-box and works with any VR applications. Multiple performance metrics on timing and positioning accuracy are con- sidered, and detailed testbed setup and measurement steps are pre- sented. We also apply our methodology to several VR systems in the market, and carefully analyze the experiment results.

 We make several observations: (i) 3D scene complexity affects the timing accuracy the most, (ii) most VR systems implement the dead reck- oning algorithm, which incurs a non-trivial correction latency after incorrect predictions, and (iii) there exists an inherent trade-off be- tween two positioning accuracy metrics: precision and sensitivity.
